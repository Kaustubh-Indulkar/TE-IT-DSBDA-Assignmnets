# Data Science And Big Data Analytics Assignments

This repository contains the solutions for a series of assignments covering Data Science And Big Data Analytics concepts. The assignments are divided into three groups:

**Group A: Hadoop Ecosystem**

This group focuses on practical experience with the Hadoop ecosystem, including installation, MapReduce programming, and HiveQL.

*   **Hadoop Installation:** Scripts and documentation for setting up single-node and multi-node Hadoop clusters.
*   **MapReduce Application:** A Java-based MapReduce program to analyze system logs and identify users with the longest login durations.  Includes sample log data and instructions for running in pseudo-distributed mode.
*   **HiveQL Operations:**  Demonstrates various HiveQL operations on a flight information system dataset, including table creation, data loading, joins, indexing, and calculating average departure delays.

**Group B: Data Analytics with Python**

This group covers data manipulation, cleaning, integration, transformation, and visualization using Python and its libraries.

*   **Facebook Metrics Analysis:** Python scripts performing data subsetting, merging, sorting, transposing, and reshaping on a Facebook metrics dataset.
*   **Air Quality and Heart Disease Data Analysis:** Python scripts for data cleaning, integration, transformation, error correction, and model building on air quality and heart disease datasets.
*   **Python and Hadoop Integration:**  Demonstrates integrating Python with Hadoop using PyHadoop for data analysis with MapReduce and data mining in Hive on a forest fire dataset.
*   **Data Visualization:** Python scripts using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the results from the Air Quality/Heart Disease and Forest Fire analyses.

**Group C: Model Implementation**

This group focuses on building practical applications, including web scraping and predictive modeling.

*   **E-commerce Review Scraper:** A Python script to scrape real-time comments, reviews, ratings, comment tags, and customer names from an e-commerce website.   
*   **Predictive Model Mini-Project:** A group project implementing various predictive modeling techniques to solve a real-life problem using the US Graduate Schools Admission Parameters dataset from Kaggle.
